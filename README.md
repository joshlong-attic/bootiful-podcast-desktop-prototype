# BootifulPodcast.fm Desktop Client

An experimental take on a desktop UI to support this use case.

## To Do

* Choose a JavaFX window icon 
* Figure out how to make this a MacOS application
* Setup CI/CD
* Some sort of UI to open older podcasts for editing?

## Attributions
* This program uses [the following Icon](http://chittagongit.com/icon/icon-connected-8.html) to indicate connectivity.
